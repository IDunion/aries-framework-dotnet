# SD-JWT for .NET (Experimental)

This is an experimental implementation of the sd-jwt specification. The purpose of this was to
understand the serialisation and deserialization of the combined issuance and presentation 
formats.

# Requirements

The intention was to use the minimum amount of dependencies, but I also tried out different jwt
libraries for decoding and encoding therefore the project currently has more dependencies than
necessary
